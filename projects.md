  <b>CIRC 2025</b> 
  <br><br>

We attended CIRC 2025 this year, which did not include a science task. Instead of attaching Rover Lab to the rover, we showcased our work on an acrylic board to present our teamâ€™s first-ever attempt at developing a working model for URC's science task. Looking ahead, we plan to compete at URC 2026, and as this was our team's inaugural effort on the science task, we learned a great deal and are excited to return with a fully integrated Rover Lab.
